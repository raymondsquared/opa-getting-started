# opa-getting-started

The Open Policy Agent (OPA, pronounced ‚Äúoh-pa‚Äù) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack.

Read this page to learn about the core concepts in OPA‚Äôs policy language (Rego) as well as how to download, run, and integrate OPA.

## üöÄ Features

- **OPA**: OPA decouples policy decision-making from policy enforcement. When your software needs to make policy decisions it queries OPA and supplies structured data as input. OPA accepts arbitrary structured data as input.
- **OPA Gatekeeper**: OPA Gatekeeper integrates OPA with Kubernetes to enforce policies and ensure compliance within Kubernetes clusters. It acts as a policy controller, using native Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define and enforce policies.
- **HTTP API Authorization**: Enforcing access control policies by evaluating incoming requests against defined rules within an OPA policy. This is typically achieved by integrating OPA into the API gateway or backend service. OPA examines request headers, payloads, and other relevant data to determine whether the user or application is authorized to perform the requested action.
- **WSO 2 API Gateway**: WSO2 API Manager is a comprehensive open-source platform that includes an API Gateway component to manage, secure, and publish APIs. It offers features such as API creation, deployment, versioning, and lifecycle management.
- **Terraform**: Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used to define and provision infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments.
- **Kafka**: Distributed streaming platform designed to handle high-throughput, real-time data feeds. It excels at capturing data from various sources, storing it persistently, and delivering it to multiple consumers.
